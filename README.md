# Lectures of Linear Algebra [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/apm/l/atomic-design-ui.svg?)]()

These lecture notes are intended for introductory linear algebra courses, suitable for university students, programmers, data analysts, algorithmic traders and etc. 

The lectures notes are loosely based on several textbooks:

1. <b><i>Linear Algebra and Its Applications</i></b> by Gilbert Strang 
2. <b><i>Linear Algebra and Its Applications</i></b> by David Lay 
3. <b><i>Introduction to Linear Algebra With Applications</i></b> by DeFranza & Gagliardi
4. <b><i>Linear Algebra With Applications</i></b> by Gareth Williams

However, the crux of the course is not about proving theorems, but to demonstrate the practices and visualization of the concepts. Thus we will not engage in precise deduction or notation, rather we aim to clarify the elusive concepts and thanks to Python/MATLAB, the task is much easier now.

## Prerequisites
Though the lectures are for beginners, it is beneficial that attendants had certain amount of exposure to linear algebra and calculus.

And also the attendee are expected to have basic knowledge (3 days training would be enough) of 
- [x] Python
- [x] NumPy
- [x] Matplotlib
- [x] SymPy

All the codes are written in an <b>intuitive manner</b> rather than efficient or professional coding style, therefore the codes are exceedingly straightforward, I presume barely anyone would have difficulty in understanding the codes.

The notes were written in JupyterLab, the interative plot requires ```ipympl```. To install, type in ```conda install -c conda-forge ipympl``` if you have JupyterLab 3.x. Check <a href='https://github.com/matplotlib/ipympl'><code>ipympl</code>page</a> for more details.

## What to Expect from Notes
These notes will equip you with most needed and basic knowledge for other subjects, such as Data Science, Econometrics, Mathematical Statistics, Financial Engineering, Control Theory and etc., which heavily rely on linear algebra. Please go through the tutorial patiently, you will certainly have a better grasp of the fundamental concepts of linear algebera. Then further step is to study the special matrices and their application with your domain knowledge.  

## Contents 
It is advisable to either open the notebooks in Jupyter nbviewers (links below) or download them, since github has lots of rendering mistakes in LaTeX and sometimes even missing plots.
